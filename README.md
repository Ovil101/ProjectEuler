# Project Euler

[Project Euler](projecteuler.net) describes itself as a "series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve." The nature of the project dictates that the solutions to problems be kept private. It is for this reason that the repository with my solutions is private and only recuiters can get access to it. If you are one and are interested in my solutions, please email me using your business email.
